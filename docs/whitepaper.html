    <h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      SomaChat is an experimental chat software that implements real-time text communcation, a mode of textual
      conversation wherein text is transmitted instantly to participants as it is being typed; this mimics voiced
      conversation in an effective way, making it a more direct and personal type of text-based interaction.
    </p>
    <p>This document describes and discusses goals, features and technical aspects of SomaChat.</p>
    <h2 id="2-motivation">2. Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In a conventional instant messaging application, conversation functions the same way a letter exchange does – a
      message is composed in its entirety before it is sent to its recipient. Instant messaging is intended to mimic
      natural conversation, but fails to effectively do so for at least two reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Low exchange rate – participants have to wait for a message to be composed and sent before they can start
        reading and interpreting it, let alone reply to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poor synchronization – it often happens that participants &quot;speak past&quot; each other and thus
        accidentally split the conversation into two, ending up in a situation where they maintain two conversation with
        each other at the same time.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Natural conversation however, happening face-to-face or over the phone, is perfectly continuous in the way content
      is delivered; as one party speaks, a listener can interpret the words and prepare a reply, and even interrupt the
      speaker should they wish to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A messaging protocol that lets participiants talk in a way that is more akin to natural conversation than letter
      exchange would disperse with the issues explained above, making online communication more direct and efficient.
    </p>
    <h2 id="3-real-time-text-in-somachat">3. Real-time text in SomaChat</h2>
    <p>
      A well-implemented real-time text communication application should let participiants talk in a way that is more
      akin to natural conversation than letter exchange. In SomaChat this is achieved in the following way:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When a user starts typing, their unfinished message is appended to each user&#39;s chat log along with an
        indicator that shows that the message is under construction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every keystroke, including backspace or pasting/deletion of multiple letters, results in the new version of the
        message replacing the old version in the chat log.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a message is finished and submitted, the &quot;active message&quot; indicator in the chat log is updated to
        reflect that the message is finalized.
      </li>
      <li>If a message in progress is deleted instead of sent, it it removed from the chat log.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This protocol effectively mimics natural conversation and, thanks to the ability to remove letters and entire
      messages in progress, allows for short non-intrusive textual interjections that mimic body language and facial
      expressions, such as &quot;nodding along&quot; to show that one is actively listening, without cluttering the chat
      log.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the protocol eliminates issues inherent to conventional instant messaging by increasing the exchange rate
      between users and as such improving their synchronization.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4-notable-features">4. Notable features</h2>
    <p>
      The core of SomaChat is the real-time aspect – everything else is auxiliary. However: presentation, performance
      and user experience matter, which is why significant effort has been spent on making the software as fast,
      scalable and intuitive as possible while at the same time making use of modern cryptographic protocols in order to
      allow for secure and authenticated conversation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="4-1-authentication">4.1. Authentication</h3>
    <p><em>Authentication</em> means plausibly proving that one is who one claims to be.</p>
    <p>
      Initially SomaChat only allowed for pseudo-authentication via tripcodes [1], an authentication scheme commonly
      used on imageboards in which a user is identified by her tripcode. SomaChat has since been extended with deniable
      authentication [2] (see section 4.1.4) by leveraging the Ethereum [3] network as a decentralized public-key
      infrastructure [4], using crypto wallet software for identity and key management [5,6], and designing and
      implementing a protocol that lets a user deniably authenticate herself to, and communicate with, other users [7].
    </p>
    <p>This section explains and discusses the means of authentication outlined above.</p>

    <h4 id="4-1-1-pseudo-authentication-via-tripcodes">4.1.1. Pseudo-authentication via tripcodes</h4>
    <p>
      A tripcode is a string of letters generated by the server from a user-provided secret [8] via the use of a
      cryptographic one-way function [9,10] and then appended to the message to act as a signature proving the
      sender&#39;s identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a tripcode-based authentication scheme is trivial to implement and easy to use, there are a number of
      fundamental issues with it:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It places an undesirable amount of trust in the chat server – as the secrets used to generate tripcodes are
        fully readable by the server, a malicious server could steal and reuse secrets in order to impersonate users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two users who happen to choose the same secret will generate the same tripcode, breaking the expectation that
        one tripcode represents one person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to the surjective (many-to-one) nature of cryptographic hash functions, and especially considering that a
        tripcode is a hash function output that has been truncated and transformed for memorability purposes, there
        exists a risk, though small, of tripcode collision, meaning that several secrets would generate the same
        tripcode, once again breaking the intuitively arrived upon expectation of uniqueness.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Despite these issues, tripcodes suffice for many use cases – specifically those wherein a user wishes to maintain
      a consistent identity between sessions without caring much about whether she later gets misrepresented or
      impersonated.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>[8]&nbsp;Though somewhat incorrect, one may think of it as a password.</li>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <h4 id="4-1-2-alternatives-to-the-tripcode-scheme">4.1.2. Alternatives to the tripcode scheme</h4>
    <p>
      Due to the glaring issues with tripcodes, most notably the security risk that comes with needing to trust the
      server, one might want to look into alternative ways to perform user authentication, preferably in a way that is
      not dependent on users having to share private information (secrets, passwords, private keys).
    </p>
    <p>
      An authentication scheme based on a public key infrastructure is a step toward this end. One may implement server
      side management of public keys in order to allow for such an infrastructure to be created. However along with this
      comes the problem of how to manage private keys:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>As the chat client runs in the browser, its authenticity is difficult to verify [11].</li>
      <li>The user is forced to trust that the client will not steal her private keys.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Fortunately there exists a robust solution that can be leveraged for a near trustless public key infrastructure
      and private key management: Ethereum and crypto wallets [3-6], respectively.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="4-1-3-crypto-wallets-for-decentralized-trustless-authentication">
      4.1.3. Crypto wallets for decentralized trustless authentication
    </h4>
    <p>
      A crypto wallet, such as MetaMask, lets a user operating a web-based client manually sign [12] a piece of data
      with a private key without the client ever gaining access to the private key itself, since the action of signing
      the data is performed completely within the confines of the crypto wallet software; what this means is that a
      malicious client cannot steal the private key as the only data to enter the crypto wallet is the data to be signed
      and the only data to leave it is the data&#39;s cryptographic signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes a crypto-wallet-as-browser-extension a perfect candidate for web-based trustless authentication as it
      enables a scheme wherein a participant signs a message once per session and is thereafter able to communicate in
      an authenticated way according to the protocol implemented by the chat client.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        [12]&nbsp;Signing proves authenticity; data can be <em>signed</em> with a private key, known only by the signer,
        and <em>verified</em> with a public key, known by everyone.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="4-1-4-deniable-authentication">4.1.4. Deniable authentication</h4>
    <p>Face-to-face conversation has two interesting properties:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication:</strong> as a listener, one implicitly knows that the words one hears are indeed being
        spoken by the speaker – this is confirmed visually and via recognition of voice – via presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deniability:</strong> it is not possible to prove afterward to a third party what the speaker said by
        relaying the words; even if one recorded the conversation (e.g. on tape), the speaker could claim that the
        recording is a forgery.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These two properties together form what is called <em>deniable authentication</em>; participants in a conversation
      can be sure who they are conversing with, but neither can prove afterward what was said or who said what.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deniable authentication can be implemented for online communication by having each pair of participants agree upon
      a <em>shared secret</em>, a symmetric encryption [13] key beknownst only to them, which is used by each party to
      encrypt and exchange their public key corresponding to the private key used for signing messages [12]. Since both
      parties know the encryption key, one could forge an encrypted signing key exchange from the other party and then
      send messages to oneself in the other party&#39;s name. This <em>forgeability</em> aspect is what lends the
      communication deniability.
    </p>
    <p>
      For group messaging, the pairwise secret key exchange may be performed for each pair of participants in the group.
      Due to the pairwise uniqueness of the shared secrets, it is not possible to successfully forge messages in another
      party&#39;s name, as that party would have a <em>different</em> shared key with another, third, party.
    </p>
    <p>
      SomaChat achieves deniable authentication via a custom protocol, described in [7]. To initiate a pairwise key
      exchange and thus a deniably authenticated session, a user first generates two keypairs: the first one she
      manually signs via a crypto wallet browser extension (such as MetaMask) allowing it to be used as an ephemeral
      authentication key; the second one remains unsigned but is exchanged pairwise with each connected user in a
      deniable fashion via a Diffie-Hellman key exchange [14].

    <h3 id="4-2-end-to-end-encryption">4.2. End-to-end encryption</h3>
    <p><em>To be implemented.</em></p>
    <p>
      End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is the scheme in which messages are encrypted sender-side and decrypted
      receiver-side, preventing the chat server to read the contents of the messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combination with the modified X3DH protocol alluded to in the previous section, an encryption scheme such as
      the <em>Double Ratchet</em> algorithm or another sufficiently secure encryption scheme can provide end-to-end
      encrypted deniably authenticated communication not necessitated upon server trust, making it a highly desirable
      feature for direct messaging or private group messaging.
    </p>
    <h3 id="4-3-chatrooms">4.3. Chatrooms</h3>
    <h4 id="4-3-1-public-chatrooms">4.3.1. Public chatrooms</h4>
    <p>
      Chatrooms let users organize conversation by topic or group. By default, rooms are public and can be joined by
      anyone. Attempting to join a room that does not exist will create the room instead. If a room goes empty, it is
      deleted after a grace period.
    </p>
    <h4 id="4-3-2-password-protected-chatrooms">4.3.2. Password-protected chatrooms</h4>
    <p>
      Password-protected chatrooms are rooms that require a password to enter. The password is set by the chatroom
      owner. The security of such a room is questionable, as a password leak would let anyone access the room&#39;s
      contents.
    </p>
    <h4 id="4-3-3-invite-only-chatrooms">4.3.3. Invite-only chatrooms</h4>
    <p><em>To be implemented.</em></p>
    <p>
      Invite-only chatrooms allow chatroom owners to specify a list of users that are uniquely allowed to participate by
      specifying their public Ethereum addresses (which are intrinsically tied to the users&#39; public/private
      keypairs). End-to-end encryption is planned to be part of this feature although its practical feasiblity requires
      further investigation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="4-4-direct-messages">4.4. Direct messages</h3>
    <p><em>To be implemented.</em></p>
    <p>
      Direct messages are not yet available as they are expected to be private (i.e. end-to-end encrypted) and
      asynchronous (a user can be messaged even if she is offline), two features which are due to be implemented at a
      later point in time.
